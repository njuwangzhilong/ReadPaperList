#### [libdft: Practical Dynamic Data Flow Tracking for Commodity Systems](https://github.com/njuwangzhilong/ReadPaperList/blob/master/papers/libdft.practicadynamicdataflowTracking.pdf)   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[**open source**](https://github.com/njuwangzhilong/ReadPaperList/tree/master/projects/libdft-3.1415alpha)
**abstract:**  *Dynamic data flow tracking (DFT) deals with tagging and tracking data of interest as they propagate during program execution.* 

#### [Argos_Practical Many-Antenna Base Stations](https://github.com/njuwangzhilong/ReadPaperList/blob/master/papers/Argos_Practical%20Many-Antenna%20Base%20Stations.pdf)   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
**abstract:**  *Multi-user multiple-input multiple-output theory predicts manyfold capacity gains by leveraging many antennas on
wireless base stations to serve multiple clients simultaneously through multi-user beamforming (MUBF). However,realizing a base station with a large number antennas is nontrivial,and has yet to be achieved in the real-world*
